## Description

Take Notes is an application using Express.js that allows you to input notes, and run them through a series of routes, which enables you to save or delete them from a JSON file. The goal of this project was to apply what I have learned about Express.js and Node.js. I also was recommended a nifty npm package called uuid by my tutor, which was massively helpful when assigning each note a unique ID. I ended up with a much clearer understanding of how to create a successful server, and now I feel more confident in incorporating npm packages where appropriate. 

## Installation

Navigate to the Heroku app. 

## Usage

Select "Get Started" from the homepage and click on the note input fields to enter your note. If you would like to edit the note, click the pencil icon. If you would like to save the note, click the disc icon. If you would like to delete the note, click the red trash can icon.

## Tests
